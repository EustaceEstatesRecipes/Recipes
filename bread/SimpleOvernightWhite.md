# Notes
 * Scaled down to one boule.
 * Simply scaled up to almost any amount

# Ingredients: Biga
 * 400g White Bread Flour
 * 275g Water (~80F)
 * ~0.4g(1/8tsp) Instant Yeast

# Steps: Biga (Hour 0)
 1. Add yeast to the water and let sit for a few minutes
 2. When bubbly (or at least cloudy), add yeasty water to flour
 3. Mix until combined and there are no visible dry spots, alternating pinch and fold
  * Pinch: Work you way up the dough and squeeze you thumb and forefinger together, sort of slicing the dough, in ~2 inch increments
  * Fold: Grab the dough from beneath on one side, then pull it up until you feel resistance, then fold it on top of itself. Continue on all four sides.
 4. Try not to overwork the dough too much

# Ingredients: Final Dough
 * 100g White Bread Flour
 * 100g Water (~100F)
 * 12g Fine Sea Salt
 * ~1g(1/4tsp) Instant Yeast
 * 675g Biga (from above)

# Steps: Final Mix (Hour 13)
 1. Add flour, yeast, and salt to a large bowl
 2. Pour the water into the flour
 3. Mix by hand until incorporated, same mixing method as before.
 4. Let sit for bulk fermentation.

# Steps: Bulk Fermentation (Hour 13-16/17)
 1. Fold the every 30 minutes for the first 90 minutes.
 2. Dough should triple in volume, generally around 3-4 hours, but go by the eye.

# Steps: Divide (If making more than one loaf) (Hour 17)
 1. Flour a work surface and your hands
 2. Ease the dough onto the work surface
 3. Sprinkle some flour at about the half-way point of the dough, then slice it along that line with a knife.

# Steps: Shape and Proof (Hour 17)
 1. Flour proofing basket
  * If you don't have proofing baskets, line a bowl with a kitchen towel.
 2. Take the dough (cut side up if you divided) and fold it on all four side.
  * Be careful to get as little flour inside the folds as possible
  * Fold the left and right sides first, then the one closest to you, then as you fold the far one, roll the dough forward into the fold, leaving the seam on the bottom
 3. Run your hands on, in a cupping motion, under the sides of the dough, spinning it to help form a round ball.
 4. Once you have a nice firm ball of dough, set it in the proofing basket seam side down
 5. Flour the top of the dough, cover with a kitchen towel, and let sit to prove for about an hour (or until it passes Finger-Dent Test).
  * Finger-Dent Test: Poke the dough with your finger, if it springs back slowly but leaving a slight indent it's ready.

# Steps: Bake (With Cast Iron Dutch Oven) (Hour 18)
 1. Preheat oven with Dutch Oven inside to 500F for 30 minutes, with the middle rack available.
  * If it's proved but you're waiting for the oven, stick the dough in the fridge.
 2. Take the dough from the basket and set it on a piece of parchment
  * At this point you can score the dough, use a very sharp knife to slice 1/4 inch deep slits on the top of the dough
 3. Very carefully remove the top of the dutch oven, set the dough inside, cover, and slide back into the oven.
 4. Bake covered for ~20 minutes
 5. Remove the cover, and back until dark golden brown ~30 minutes (again, eyes are better than timers)
  * The darker the loaf, the crustier the bread. If you want a softer loaf, bake it a little lighter, but be careful no to underbake
  6. Remove from oven when done (use the knock test), and let cool on a wire rack.
   * Knock Test: When you knock on the bottom of the loaf, it should have a hollow sound.

# Steps: Bake (Without Cast Iron) (Hour 18)
1. Preheat oven to 500F for 30 minutes, with one rack in the middle, and one below that.
 * If it's proved but you're waiting for the oven, stick the dough in the fridge.
2. On the lower rack, place a sheet pan filled with kitchen towels that have been soaked in water (want to create some steam).
 * If you don't have enough kitchen towels, a pan of water should work fine as well, you may have to add some more right before putting in the dough
3. Take the dough from the basket and set it on a piece of parchment
 * At this point you can score the dough, use a very sharp knife to slice 1/4 inch deep slits on the top of the dough
4. Place dough on a sheet pan on the middle rack, cook for ~25 minutes
5. Remove the lower sheet pan of water and cook for another ~25 minutes, or until dark golden brown.
 * The darker the loaf, the crustier the bread. If you want a softer loaf, bake it a little lighter, but be careful no to underbake
6. Remove from oven when done (use the knock test), and let cool on a wire rack.
 * Knock Test: When you knock on the bottom of the loaf, it should have a hollow sound.
